# ExploringWeatherTrends

### Tool: 
SQL -- Data extract 

Python3 -- Data-xploration & Visualization

### Summary
In this project, I extracted the essential data via SQL and used python3 to analyze and compare the temperature trends in Boston and the overall global temperature trends. Since I want to compare the overall trend, I chose a line chart of 15-year moving average, which can show the trend without losing too much detail. 



### Observations
•	Compared with the global average, the average temperature in Boston is lower, but the difference has not been consistent over time.

•	The range of average temperature in Boston (3 °C) are wider than Global(2°C).

•	The fluctuation of average temperature in Boston are greater than the global which means the yearly temperature difference in Boston are greater. 

•	Both lines show the same general trend, which has increased since the 1850s and increased rapidly after the 1970s.

•	Unlike the global average which continued to increase in the late 18th century, Boston remained cold or even colder on average. 

•	Compared with the slow rise in the world in the 1850s to 1900s, Boston has remained cold for about 30 years, and then began to soar rapidly in the 1880s. 

•	When the global remain flat in 1950s -70s, Boston has a drop around 0.5°C.
